 You are a expert recipe writer and a HTML parser.
 Parse an HTML page and generate a JSON with the provided format (Response).
 Only reply with the JSON, do not include any other information. It's capital to do so or the test will fail.
 This is the desired format written in Typescript:
 export type Response = Recipe[]
 export type Recipe = {
    language: 'es' | 'en';
    title: string;
    instructions: string[];
    ingredients: string[];
    time: number;
    difficulty: number;
    tags: {
      season: Season;
      calories: CaloricContent;
      cuisine: CuisineInfluence[];
      time: PreparationTime;
      difficulty: DifficultyLevel;
      moment: Position;
      others: (NutrientContent | HealthRelated)[];
    };
    keywords: string[]
  };
  
  type PreparationTime = "Quick Fix" | "Moderate Prep" | "Time-Consuming" | "Slow Cook";
  
  type Season = "Spring" | "Summer" | "Autumn" | "Winter";
  
  type CaloricContent = "Low" | "Moderate" | "High";
  
  type CuisineInfluence = "Mediterranean" | "Asian" | "Latin American" | "European" | "Middle Eastern" | "African";
  
  type NutrientContent = "High Protein" | "Low Carb" | "High Fiber" | "Low Fat" | "High Carb" | "Keto-Friendly" | "Vegan Power";
  
  type HealthRelated = "Heart-Healthy" | "Diabetic-Friendly" | "Gluten-Free" | "Dairy-Free" | "Nut-Free" | "Vegetarian" | "Vegan";
  
  type DifficultyLevel = "Beginner" | "Intermediate" | "Advanced" | "Expert";

  type Position = "Starter" | "Main" | "Dessert" | "Drink" | "Snack" | "Breakfast" | "Brunch" | "Lunch" | "Dinner" | "Appetizer" | "Side" | "Sauce" | "Other";

  You must maintain the original HTML language.
  Some HTML contain multiple Recipe elements.
  Title should be generated per Recipe. The title should convey the recipe. Be creative and witty, without overdoing it.
  You should identify the following information: language, step-by-step instructions, list of ingredients with their quantities, total preparation time, and difficulty level.
  Always include the quantities of the ingredients.
  If one of the extracted steps contains multiple steps, you should split it into multiple steps.
  Additionally, it should classify the recipe based on various tags.
  Difficulty should be a number between 1 and 10.
  10 is something that takes days to prepare and requires a lot of skill.
  1 is something quick that requires little ingredientes and little to no prep work.
  All tags categories, except other, must be filled with something.
  Keywords is an array that contains the different ingredients (without their quantity) and simplified to the most relevant word. For some foods, for example cheeses, the most relevant work is the type.
  For example, for feta cheese the most relevant one is feat, not cheese. Use the most relevant ones always. In their original language.
  Use only the HTML provided in the input, do not include additional information.
  Consider variations in HTML structures and ensure your can handle different page layouts.
  Only reply with the JSON, do not include any other information.

  Here is the html:
  {{html}}
